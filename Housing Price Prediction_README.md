*Housing Price Prediction*

*Simple Overview*

This project leverages machine learning models to predict housing prices based on various property and neighborhood features. The dataset includes detailed information on housing attributes and sales prices, enabling comprehensive analysis and modeling for accurate predictions.

*Overview*

Accurate housing price predictions are critical for real estate market analysis and decision-making. This project uses data-driven techniques to analyze housing attributes, such as lot size, neighborhood, building quality, and sales conditions, to forecast sale prices. The dataset comprises 82 features, including categorical and numerical attributes. Advanced preprocessing and machine learning methods are employed to ensure robust and reliable predictions. The project evaluates multiple regression models to determine the most effective approach for predicting housing prices and offers valuable insights into key factors influencing real estate values.

*Data Description*

*Dataset*

*Training Dataset:*
Size: 1,000 rows and 82 columns.
Key Features:
Property Characteristics: Lot size, building type, year built, garage details, etc.
Neighborhood Information: Zoning, street type, and overall quality of surroundings.
Sales Information: Sale type, condition, and final sale price.
Target Variable: SalePrice (continuous variable representing housing prices).

*Test Dataset:*
Size: 446 rows and 81 columns (excluding SalePrice).

*Preprocessing Steps*
Handling Missing Data:
Features like LotFrontage, Alley, and GarageType have missing values.
Missing data was imputed or replaced with placeholder values based on feature context.
Feature Engineering:
Extracted and created meaningful features, e.g., age of the house (YrSold - YearBuilt).
Categorical Encoding:
Encoded categorical variables using label encoding or one-hot encoding for machine learning models.
Normalization:
Applied normalization to numerical variables to standardize data for modeling.

*Machine Learning Models*
Multiple regression algorithms were applied, including:
Linear Regression
Ridge and Lasso Regression
Gradient Boosting Regressors
Random Forest Regressors
Evaluation metrics included RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and RÂ².

*Exploratory Data Analysis*
Analyzed feature distributions, correlations, and outliers.
Key Insights:
Features like OverallQual, GrLivArea, and TotalBsmtSF showed strong correlations with SalePrice.
Neighborhood and zoning details significantly influence housing prices.

*Potential Use Cases*
Real estate market analysis and pricing strategies.
Automated property valuation tools for real estate agents and buyers.
Insights into factors impacting property value for urban planning.
